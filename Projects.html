        <h4> Data Structures (C++) Project: Examination and Visualization of Behavior Amazon Customers </h4>
        <div id="text" class="Text">
            <li> Implemented knowledge and research of Strongly Connected Components and Graph Coloring in Depth First Search Traversal to produce deliverables that showcase common themes in product purchases </li>
            <li> Drove and collaborated with a team of four in order to achieve frequent and necessary debugging benchmarks </li>
            <li> Produced working Makefiles corresponding to C++ code for cyclic and efficient testing of graph algorithm </li>
            <li> Consistently collaborated and worked on visualizations to point to consumer trends in relation to "Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought" </li>

        <h4> Checkers Game using API: Java Project </h4>
        <div id="text" class="Text">
            <li> Developed a checkers game to apply knowledge of buttons and game algorithms utilizing Java </li>
            <li> Executed tasks on fetching data from server, code for checker board’s layout, buttons and appending relevant web API to enhance User Interface </li>
            <li> Created Drawable Resource files including pieces, layout and activity files to upgrade aesthetic of user viewable layout </li>
            <li> Implemented algorithm for Main Logic including Logic for King Piece for working of checkers game </li>
            <li> Utilized Android Studio and Github as software to increase efficiency in publishing and retrieving code </li>

        <h4> Mathematical Exploration: Approximating Solutions to First Order Differential Equations </h4>
        <div id="text" class="Text">
            <li> Investigated two methods of approximation of First Order Differential Equations - Euler’s Method and Midpoint Method - to accomplish objective of comparing efficiency of approximation </li>
            <li> Implemented two python programs to produce 101 data points to compare closeness to Runge-Kutta method’s (⅜) solution </li>
            <li> Organized both methods’ solution points in Excel Spreadsheet to calculate variance, standard deviation and mean of accuracy as compared to Runge-Kutta solution’s data points </li>
            <li> Analyzed reasons for faster convergence to solution in case of Midpoint Method and reflected on both methods’ utilization in estimating trajectories </li>
